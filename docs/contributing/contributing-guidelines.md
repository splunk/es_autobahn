### Create a local environment for testing

Testing locally will be a great way to ensure your changes will work with what currently exists. 

The easiest way to get started is by using a python virtual environment. For simplicity, `pipenv` will be used for the following.

1. Install python and pipenv on your local workstation -> [Pipenv docs](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/#installation){ target=_blank }.
1. Once installed, navigate to your forked repository and run the following to install the latest requirements.

    ```shell
    # your forked rba directory
    # ./rba
    pipenv install -r docs/requirements.txt
    ```

1. Now you can enter `pipenv run mkdocs serve` which will create a webserver that can be reached by opening your browser and navigating to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000){ target=_blank }.
