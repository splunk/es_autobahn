# RBA all day

## Welcome to the wonderful world of Risk-Based Alerting!

RBA is Splunk's method to aggregate low-fidelity security events as interesting observations tagged with security metadata to create high-fidelity, low-volume alerts.

## [Searches](searches/index.md)

Useful SPL from the RBA community for working with risk events.

## [Dashboards](dashboards/index.md)

Simple XML or JSON for Splunk dashboards to streamline risk analysis.

## Risk Rules

Splunk's Threat Research Team has an incredible library of over 1000 detections in the Splunk's [Enterprise Security Content Updates](https://research.splunk.com/){ target=_blank } library. You can use Marcus Ferrera and Drew Church's awesome [ATT&CK Detections Collector](https://github.com/splunk/attack-detections-collector){ target=_blank } to pop out a handy HTML file of relevant ESCU detections for you to align with MITRE ATT&CK.
